# Foodsby Code Challenge

For the challenge you choose please meet the following requirements:

- Where appropriate use a data store of your choice.
- Use any external libraries you like.
- Be ready to discuss your recommendations to make your solution suitable for use in a production environment.
- The end result should be a functional implementation of the problem with associated tests.
- Provide the working code either in a publicly accessible hosted repository or a private one which you will invite your reviewers to.
- Mobile responsiveness is a plus, but not required.
- A README.md file with instructions for installing, testing, running and interacting with your application and any details you feel are relevant to share. Those reviewing your project should be able to run the application locally with only the instructions from your README file.

## Challenge:

The goal for this exercise is to create a web application using provided assets, designs and data mocks ups. Ideally the application will consist of separate web components which can be interacted with. When a user clicks on a new date in the date picker, the content on the page should be swapped out based on the JSON file provided. Clicking on the 'Select Restaurant' button should have a modal pop up showing which restaurant you selected and the modal can be dismissed to pick another day or restaurant.

Complete the exercise using React. You may use any JS based templating libraries, CSS preprocessors, and JS transpilers you like. Additionally you can choose any _modern_ JS libraries you like. Write a few simple integration tests using Jest (with preferably react-testing-library, but this part is optional) Use Node.JS to run the application and perform your tests. Please feel free to ask questions and have fun!
